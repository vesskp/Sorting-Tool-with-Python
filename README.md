This is the *Sorting Tool with Python* project I made myself.


<div>
<div>You will practice concepts frequently tested in technical interviews at top tech companies.</div>

<p>In the modern world, data has become so abundant that processing it is no easy business. How can anyone make sense of all those words and numbers? In this project, you will write a program that processes textual and numeric data and sorts it. Your program will be able to determine the largest or most frequent pieces of data and perform the necessary calculations on them. Data is waiting to be sorted!</p>
